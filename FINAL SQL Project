# In this project, I am working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists,albums,media tracks,invoices, and customers.
# And below are my answers to the example questions in the final SQL project. 
# Note that there are often multiple ways to write SQL to come up with the same answer. 


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName,LastName,CustomerId,Country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country<>'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName,cust.LastName,invo.invoiceid,invo.billingcountry,invo.invoicedate
FROM chinook.invoices as invo
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON invo.customerid=cust.customerid
WHERE invo.BillingCountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName,emp.LastName,inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName,emp.FirstName,cust.FirstName,cust.LastName,cust.Country,inv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name,i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.trackid=t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist,t.name as Track,i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid=t.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name as 'Track Name',a.title as 'Album Title',m.name as 'Media Type',g.name as 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid=t.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreID=t.GenreID;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName,emp.LastName,ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT em.FirstName,em.LastName,ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
WHERE emp.title='Sales Support Agent'
AND Inv.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total),2)) desc limit 1;

#15. Which track name has the most bytes?
SELECT name,max(bytes)
FROM chinook.tracks
ORDER BY bytes desc limit 1;

#16. What is the unit price of each track name?
SELECT Name,UnitPrice 
FROM chinook.tracks;

#17. List all the artists names.
SELECT name
FROM chinook.artists;
